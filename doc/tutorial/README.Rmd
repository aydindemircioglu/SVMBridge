# Tutorial

**mlrMBO** is a framework for the (sequential) Model Based parameter Optimization.
The goal is to optimize numeric or discrete influence parameters
of a non-linear black box function like an industrial simulator or  a time-consuming algorithm.

In the following we provide an in-depth introduction to **mlrMBO**. An introductory example serves as a quickstart guide.
Note that our focus is on your comprehension of the basic functions and
applications. For detailed technical information and manual pages, please refer to
the package's [manual pages](http://berndbischl.github.io/mlrMBO/man/). They are regularly updated and reflect the documentation of the current packages on CRAN.
