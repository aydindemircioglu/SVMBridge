  abstract	= {This paper presents an original and effective application
		  of support vector clustering (SVC) to electrical load
		  pattern classification. The proposed SVC-based approach
		  combines the calculation of the support vectors, carried
		  out by using a classical procedure adopting a Gaussian
		  kernel, with a specifically developed deterministic
		  algorithm to form the clusters. This algorithm exploits the
		  meaningful location of the bounded support vectors (BSVs)
		  to define the outliers, identifying the clusters in
		  function of the distance of the non-BSVs to the BSVs. Its
		  implementation is less computationally intensive than other
		  existing approaches and the cluster formation is driven by
		  a single user-defined threshold. Extended comparison to
		  other clustering methods is included to show the
		  effectiveness of the proposed approach in grouping
		  multidimensional load pattern data into non-overlapping
		  clusters. This effectiveness is confirmed by the
		  calculation of various cluster validity indicators. In
		  particular, the most successful tasks are the
		  identification of the outliers and the more effective
		  formation of small numbers of clusters with respect to
		  other methods.},

		  topic hierarchies or taxonomies is a crucial step in
		  knowledge and content management. Standard machine learning
		  techniques like support vector machines and related large
		  margin methods have been successfully applied for this
		  task, albeit the fact is that they ignore the inter-class
		  relationships. Unfortunately, in the context of document
		  categorization, we face a large number of classes and a
		  huge number of relevant features needed to distinguish
		  between them. The computational cost of training a
		  classifier for a problem of this size is prohibitive. It
		  has also been observed that obtaining a classifier that
		  discriminates between two groups of classes is much easier
		  than distinguishing simultaneously among all classes. This
		  has prompted substantial research in using hierarchical
		  classifiers to address single multi-class problems. In this
		  paper, we propose a novel hierarchical classification
		  method that generalizes support vector machine learning
		  that is based on the results of support vector clustering
		  method, and are structured in a way that mirrors the class
		  hierarchy. Compared to previous non-hierarchical \{SVM\}
		  classifier and famous documents categorization systems, the
		  proposed hierarchical \{SVM\} classification has a better
		  improvement in classification accuracy in the standard
		  Reuters corpus. "

		  smaller market and is useful for decision makers to reach
		  all customers effectively with one basic marketing mix.
		  Although several clustering algorithms have been proposed
		  to deal with marketing segmentation problems, a soundly
		  method seems to be limited. In this paper, support vector
		  clustering (SVC) is used for marketing segmentation. A case
		  study of a drink company is used to demonstrate the
		  proposed method and compared with the k-means and the
		  self-organizing feature map (SOFM) methods. On the basis of
		  the numerical results, we can conclude that \{SVC\}
		  outperforms the other methods in marketing segmentation. "

@Article{	  tsang2006,
  abstract	= {Kernel methods, such as the support vector machine (SVM),
		  are often formulated as quadratic programming (QP)
		  problems. However, given m training patterns, a naive
		  implementation of the QP solver takes O(m3) training time
		  and at least O(m2) space. Hence, scaling up these QPs is a
		  major stumbling block in applying kernel methods on very
		  large data sets, and a replacement of the naive method for
		  finding the QP solutions is highly desirable. Recently, by
		  using approximation algorithms for the minimum enclosing
		  ball (MEB) problem, we proposed the core vector machine
		  (CVM) algorithm that is much faster and can handle much
		  larger data sets than existing SVM implementations.
		  However, the CVM can only be used with certain kernel
		  functions and kernel methods. For example, the very popular
		  support vector regression (SVR) cannot be used with the
		  CVM. In this paper, we introduce the center-constrained MEB
		  problem and subsequently extend the CVM algorithm. The
		  generalized CVM algorithm can now be used with any
		  linear/nonlinear kernel and can also be applied to kernel
		  methods such as SVR and the ranking SVM. Moreover, like the
		  original CVM, its asymptotic time complexity is again
		  linear in m and its space complexity is independent of m.
		  Experiments show that the generalized CVM has comparable
		  performance with state-of-the-art SVM and SVR
		  implementations, but is faster and produces fewer support
		  vectors on very large data sets.},
