**SVMBridge** has some helper functions that might be of use outside the SVM context. We give a short list here, for more, please refer to the corresponding documentation.

- **expandTilde**: This will expand a path containing a tilde (=home directory on Unix-like OSs) into a full path, e.g. '~/R' might expand to '/home/user/R' on Unix or '/Users/user/R' on Windows.

- **bashExpand**: This will try to escape a filename by adding quotes and other things to it, so a wrapper can assemble its command line easily.
