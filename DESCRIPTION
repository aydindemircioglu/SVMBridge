Package: SVMBridge
Title: A bridge to integrate different SVM solvers into R
Description: Different SVM solvers are commonly used, e.g. LIBSVM and SVMperf.
	Unfortunately, many of these do not come with an direct interface to R,
	and writing such an interface might be complicated. Instead, this package
	helps with controlling different SVM solvers by interfacing with them via
	command line in a transparent fashion.
