Package: SVMBridge
Title: A Bridge to Integrate Different 'SVM' Solvers into R
Description: In machine learning, different 'SVM' solvers are commonly used, 
    e.g. 'LIBSVM' and 'SVMperf' are two of the more popular ones. 
    Unfortunately, many of these do not come with an interface to R.
	While linking such packages directly via packages like 'Rcpp' is quite hard,
    even writing simple command-line interfaces get tedious at times. This package 
    remedies the situation by providing predefined, but extensible interfaces and
    provides several interfaces to many 'SVM' solvers.
